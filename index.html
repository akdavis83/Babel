  The Tower of Babel

  The Tower of Babel: They built unto heaven as a pretense for building unto self but they never intended to go beyond the 2nd heaven. They had no interest in heaven or God, they were only interested in making a name for themselves. They scoped out a place, got some super sticky slime and began making bricks for a tower. As our world becomes smaller we see the reversal of the scattering and we see a new end time resurgence of the urge and tendency to gather together for evil against God. Most are not bold enough to openly rebel and so the show of building towards Him is the same but there is no substance to it. Make no mistake about it, Babel was open defiance toward God who had already commanded the people to spread and go from Eden. What are we building and why? To who are we truly building? Are we kingdom building or building our own little kingdoms? What is our heart posture as we build? Unity is our greatest strength that goes mostly untapped and unutilized. True relationship with God is pleasing in His sight, it is real, and it is powerful to walk with God with a pure heart fervently. We are gathered in Christ or scattered abroad.

  1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. 2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. 4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one anotherâ€™s speech. 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
